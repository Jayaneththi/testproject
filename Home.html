        <p>The pioneer television station in Sri Lanka. Started operations on 13th April 1979 With very modest beginnings, and very basic equipment comprising a 1KW transmitter and a 65 foot antenna mast, ITN beamed programs to a radius of about 15 miles in and around Colombo. On 5th June 1979 ITN was converted to a government owned business undertaking, under a Competent Authority. In 1992 ITN was converted to a public company under State jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>Subsequently both program and engineering services were extended. With Thirty Six years behind us local programs are given pride of place catering to all strata of society News and Current Affairs, Music and Variety, Drama are given pride of place. Special emphasis is also given to Children’s and Women’s and religious programs. ITN now has a daily transmission of 20 hours. There is also a small component of English programs mainly feature films and dramas with worldwide appeal. On the Engineering side five transmitting stations spread throughout the Island we are able to cover most parts of the Island. With the establishment of another transmitting station in the central hilly region it is expected that ITN programs will cover the entire Island.</p>
